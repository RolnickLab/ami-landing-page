  "ABOUT_CONTENT_DESCRIPTION": "There are over a million known species of insects on Earth, representing nearly one half of all known organisms. Insects are instrumental to ecosystem functioning and provide services that are critical for humans, such as pollination and the control of pests and disease vectors. In many areas, the populations of a wide array of insect species are declining in abundance and diversity due to multiple stressors including climate change and human augmented landscapes. These changes raise concerns about the knock-on impact on ecosystem health and potential global ecological and economic consequences.\n\nStill, data on insect populations remains sparse. It is challenging and resource-intensive to collect and process data as well as to train subject matter experts to support the study and conservation of insects. There is therefore a worldwide need for robust, cost-effective monitoring methods to fill the data gap in a way that minimizes bias and maximizes the quantity and quality of data collected.\n\nAMI addresses this gap and enables scientists to track or predict insect biodiversity loss and mitigate its impacts on ecosystem functioning, human health, livelihoods, and economies. AMI currently focuses on the monitoring of one of the most biodiverse groups of insects: moths.",
  "ABOUT_CONTENT_TITLE": "Why AMI is Needed",
  "ABOUT_INTRO_DESCRIPTION": "AMI is an [international consortium of experts](/consortium) developing non-lethal, end-to-end monitoring solutions for automated insect detection and species classification that leverage artificial intelligence (AI). Through technologies such as high-resolution cameras, low-cost sensors, and AI-based processing methods, AMI aims to make insect monitoring less labour-intensive, more user-friendly, and more effective at determining the state of insect populations across the globe. AMI strives to foster partnerships and knowledge-sharing to maximize the impact of monitoring and conservation efforts.",

  "INITIATIVE_AGZERO_DESCRIPTION": "AgZero+ is an ambitious five-year research programme supporting the UK’s transition towards domestic food production that is sustainable, carbon-neutral and has a positive effect on nature. UKCEH AMI systems are deployed across a range of farms to test their ability to monitor impacts of farming practise on nocturnal insect communities.",

  "INITIATIVE_AMBER_DESCRIPTION": "The AMBER project, funded by the Abrdn Charitable Foundation, will develop and trial AMI technology for monitoring nocturnal insects, with a focus on tropical deployments. The project will combine expertise from UKCEH, the Alan Turing institute, and a range of local partners, to push the current generation of AMI hardware to their limits.\n\nThe Alan Turing Institute contributes to the AMBER project by developing and implementing machine learning models for AMI systems. With an emphasis on edge-based processing, these models are optimised to run directly on Raspberry Pi devices, enabling data analysis and species identification to take place entirely in the field. This approach significantly reduces the need for large-scale data transfer and reliance on researchers manually collecting data in person.",

  "INITIATIVE_AMI_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION": "The UKCEH AMI System consists of UV and white lights for attracting moths, high-capacity data storage to collate images over long sampling periods, battery and solar power to allow for deployment away from mains power, and customisable sampling schedules. The images it collects can be processed through one’s own workflow or using Antenna, the AMI data platform. Work is underway to add additional features to the UKCEH AMI System to widen the taxonomic groups that it can monitor. The addition of audible and ultrasound recording will shortly increase the taxonomic coverage of the trap to include birds, bats, and orthoptera.",

As human activity profoundly alters the map of life on local and global scales, our response requires knowledge of plant and animal distributions across vast landscapes and over long periods of time. Vermonters cannot respond effectively to climate change, natural disasters, invasive species, and other environmental and economic threats without a new understanding of the state’s living resources.",

  "INITIATIVE_IMPERFECT_DESCRIPTION": "AMI will generate unprecedented amounts of site occupancy and abundance data.
