        The AMI System covers the entire lifecycle of the data: the hardware to
        capture images, the software to process and classify the images, and
        tools to aid in the rigorous analysis of AMI datasets. All services are
        <i>Ã  la carte</i>: each can be opted in or out. AMI currently focuses on
        moth monitoring.
