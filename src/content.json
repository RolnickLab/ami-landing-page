      "title": "What is Automated Monitoring of Insects (AMI)?",
      "text": "AMI is a non-lethal, end-to-end monitoring solution for automated insect detection and species classification that leverages machine learning (artificial intelligence). AMI can be used to process, analyse, quality control and compile large batches of standardised data in near real-time. It is brought to you by a <a href=\"/consortium\">consortium of international experts</a>."

      "title": "Why AMI is Needed",
      "text": "There are over a million known species of insects on Earth, representing nearly one half of all known organisms. Insects provide essential services that are critical for humans, such as the pollination of fruit, vegetables, and flowers or the control of pests and disease vectors, among others. Insect populations are declining in abundance and diversity due to multiple stressors including deforestation and insecticides. These changes raise concerns about ecosystem health and potential global ecological and economic consequences.\n\nStill, data on insect populations is sparse. It is challenging and resource-intensive to collect data and train subject matter experts to scale up the study and conservation of insects. There is therefore a worldwide need for robust, cost-effective methods to fill the data gap in a way that minimizes bias and maximizes the quantity and quality of data collected.\n\nAMI fills that gap to enable scientists to track or predict insect biodiversity loss and mitigate its impacts on human health, livelihoods, and economies."

It is device-agnostic and can be used for images taken by any camera. It rapidly performs fine-grained species classification and new species discovery using the GBIF and Darwin Core Standards. Experts review the classifications and rectify them as needed, thereby improving the accuracy of the algorithms. The Mila AMI Data Platform and its Companion are open source and have been developed in collaboration with AMI Consortium Partners (see GitHub repository for list of contributors). Public contributions to improve its performance and/or to enrich its offerings are most welcome.",
